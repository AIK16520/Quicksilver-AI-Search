# Market Intelligence Search Guide

## Overview

The Market Intelligence search is an enhanced, multi-dimensional analysis system that goes beyond simple keyword search. Instead of just finding articles, it **decomposes complex queries** and analyzes market spaces across **6 key dimensions**:

1. **Company Landscape** - Key players, startups, incumbents
2. **Technology Landscape** - Tech stacks, tools, platforms
3. **Business Models** - Pricing strategies, monetization
4. **Innovations** - Recent innovations, differentiators
5. **Market Trends** - Growth dynamics, future outlook
6. **Competitive Intelligence** - Competitor discovery & mapping

## When to Use This vs. Regular Search

### Use Market Intelligence When:
- You have a **complex company/product description** to analyze
- You want to understand an **entire market space**, not just find articles
- You need insights on **competitors, technologies, and business models**
- You're doing **market research** or **competitive analysis**

**Example Query:**
```
"I have a company that does hedge fund and trade analysis using AI. 
It has agents that scrape market data, pricing data, and financial news 
and gives funds automated updates if anything changes. 
Give me updates in the space."
```

### Use Regular Search When:
- You have a **specific question** about a known company
- You want **recent news** about a portfolio company
- You're looking for **specific information**, not market overview

## How It Works

### Step 1: Query Decomposition
The system uses AI to break down your query into structured components:

```json
{
  "domain": ["hedge funds", "financial trading"],
  "technologies": ["AI agents", "web scraping", "automation"],
  "data_sources": ["market data", "pricing data", "financial news"],
  "problem_solved": "Automated analysis and alerts for hedge funds",
  "value_proposition": "Real-time automated updates on market changes",
  "keywords": ["hedge fund", "trading", "AI", "automation", "market data"],
  "industries": ["fintech", "asset management"]
}
```

### Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Search
For each dimension, the system generates targeted search queries:

**Companies Dimension:**
- "top companies in hedge funds"
- "leading hedge funds AI startups"
- "AI agents companies in hedge funds"

**Technology Dimension:**
- "AI agents in hedge funds"
- "web scraping tools for trading"
- "technology stack for hedge funds"

**Business Models Dimension:**
- "hedge funds SaaS pricing models"
- "how hedge fund companies monetize"

**Innovations Dimension:**
- "latest innovations in hedge funds"
- "new AI agents solutions for hedge funds"
- "hedge fund startup innovations 2024 2025"

**Market Trends Dimension:**
- "hedge funds market trends 2024"
- "hedge funds industry analysis"

**Competitive Intelligence:**
- Uses the competitor discovery service to find companies
- Searches for "competitors in [your space]"

### Step 3: AI-Powered Aggregation
The system synthesizes all findings into:
- **Executive Summary** - 2-3 sentence overview
- **Key Players** - 5-7 companies with descriptions
- **Emerging Trends** - 3-5 key trends
- **Recommended Next Steps** - Actionable recommendations

## Frontend Usage

```javascript
import searchAPI from './utils/api';

// Perform market intelligence analysis
const result = await searchAPI.analyzeMarketIntelligence(
  "Your detailed company/space description",
  {
    maxResultsPerDimension: 8,
    includeAiInsights: true,
    formatType: "api"
  }
);

// Access the results
const { data } = result;

console.log(data.executive_summary);
console.log(data.key_players);
console.log(data.dimensions.companies.companies_mentioned);
```

## Python Usage

```python
from search.search import SearchService

service = SearchService()

# Perform market intelligence analysis
report = service.analyze_market_intelligence(
    query="""I have a company that does hedge fund and trade analysis using AI. 
             It has agents that scrape market data, pricing data, and financial news 
             and gives funds automated updates if anything changes. 
             Give me updates in the space.""",
    max_results_per_dimension=8,
    include_ai_insights=True,
    format_type="api"
)

print(report['executive_summary'])
print(report['key_players'])

# Access dimensional results
companies = report['dimensions']['companies']
print(f"Found {companies['article_count']} articles")
print(f"Companies: {companies['companies_mentioned']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Descriptive**: Include what the company does, what tech it uses, and what problem it solves
2. **Mention Specifics**: Include data sources, customer types, key features
3. **Ask for "the space"**: Use phrases like "give me updates in the space" or "analyze the market"
4. **Review All Dimensions**: Don't just look at the summaryâ€”each dimension has valuable insights
5. **Follow Recommended Steps**: The AI suggests next steps based on findings

## Performance Notes

- Analysis takes 30-60 seconds (multiple web searches + AI processing)
- Rate-limited to avoid API throttling
- Results are cached in the response (no database storage yet)
- Best with OpenAI API key (falls back to rule-based without)
